In this project I have implemented sorting algorithm analyzer using Python and tkinter for GUI. I have bulit this project from scratch. This project compares 
different algorithm and shows the most efficient algorithm. Also I have plotted the graph for different datasets, which shows how quick sort is more efficient 
for large data sets. I have implemented following algorithms.

•	Mergesort
•	Heapsort
•	Quicksort (Regular quick sort* and quick sort using 3 medians)
•	Insertion sort
•	Selection sort
•	Bubble sort
